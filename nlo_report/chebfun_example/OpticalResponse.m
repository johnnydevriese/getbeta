%% Introduction
%
% The optical response of a material is the measure of how the molecular 
% polarization $P$ changes with respect to an applied electric field strength $E$.
% In most cases $P$ is analytic in $E$ and can be written as a Taylor
% series.
%
% $$
% P(E) = P_0 + \alpha E + \beta E^2 + \gamma E^3 + \cdots
% $$
%
% Here $P_0$ is the static polarization of the molecule which does not affect the optical response 
% (the optical response only depends on the derivatives of $P$).
% The nonlinear optical response is characterized by the coefficients 
% corresponding to powers of $E$ greater than $1$. If the potential $V(x)$ of a 
% given molecule is known the polarization can be computed by constructing 
% the Hamiltonian $H$ and solving the Schroedinger eigenvalue problem. 
%
% $$
% H = -\frac12 \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V(x)
% $$
%
% $$
% H \psi(x) = \lambda \psi(x)
% $$
%
% If the $\lambda$ are countably many and can be ordered as 
% $\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 \leq \lambda_3 \leq \ldots$ then the polarization is 
% computed by the formula,
%
% $$
% P = \frac{\int x |\psi_1(x)|^2 dx}{\int |\psi_1(x)|^2 dx} 
% $$
%
% where $\psi_1(x)$ is the first eigenfunction, also known as the ground state of the system. To add
% the contributions of the applied electric field strength $E$ a linear term is
% added to the Hamiltonian.
%
% $$
% H(E) = -\frac12 \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V(x) + Ex
% $$
%
% Solutions to Schroedinger's equation now depend on the parameter $E$.
%
% $$
% H(E) \psi(E,x) = \lambda(E) \psi(E,x)
% $$
% 
% If $E$ is not too large then the polarization can still be computed as
% before.
%
% $$
% P(E) = \frac{\int x |\psi_1(E,x)|^2 dx}{\int |\psi_1(E,x)|^2 dx} 
% $$
%
% From the Taylor series we see that the nonlinear optical response is
% characterized by higher order derivatives of $P(E)$ at $E = 0$, [1]. 

%% The quantum harmonic oscillator
% One example of a simple molecule is a single
% electron bound by a quadratic potential $V(x) = 2x^2$. The solutions of
% this system are the Hermite functions. These can be computed easily using
% Chebfun.

L = 8;
H = @(E) chebop(@(x,u) -.5*diff(u,2) + 2*x.^2.*u + E*x.*u,[-L,L],'dirichlet');
[PSI,LAMBDA] = eigs(H(0),4,'sr');
LW = 'linewidth'; FS = 'fontsize';
plot(PSI,LW,2);

% To see an alternative method for computing eigenfunctions of the
% Schroedinger equation using Chebfun checkout the command `quantumstates`.

%%
% A local function to compute the polarization is defined and passed to the
% Chebfun constructor.

Emax = .1;
x = chebfun('x',[-L,L]);

function pval = polarization(efield)
    [psi,lambda]=eigs(H(efield),1,'sr');
    pval = ((x.*psi)'*psi)/(psi'*psi);
end

P = chebfun(@polarization,[-Emax,Emax],'vectorize','eps',1e-10);

% Unfortunately the errors in approximating $P(E)$ are significant enough
% to affect the interpolant and a larger truncation tolerance was required to
% get convergence in a reasonable time.

%%
% Taking derivatives of $P(E)$ at $E = 0$ gives the various optical
% response coefficients. For this particular example it can be shown that
% $\alpha = \frac14$, $\beta = 0$ and $\gamma \approx 0$.

dP = diff(P);
alpha = dP(0)

d2P = diff(P,2);
beta = d2P(0)/2

d3P = diff(P,3);
gamma = d3P(0)/6
